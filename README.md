My First Java Project:
Welcome to my first Java project! I'm thrilled to embark on my programming journey and share this experience with you.


Project Description:
This project is a simple system developed in Java, representing the beginning of my learning journey in programming. 
The application currently covers basic concepts of the Java language, and though it's straightforward, I'm excited to
share it and learn more along the way.


Future Objectives
As part of my ongoing learning process, I have some future goals to enhance this system:

- Database Integration: I plan to implement a database registration feature to store information more persistently.

- Interface Improvements: I'll seek to enhance the user interface to make the experience more intuitive and enjoyable.

- Additional Features: I will explore adding new functionalities and features to make the system more comprehensive and useful.

How to Contribute
If you're interested in contributing or have suggestions to improve this project, feel free to open issues or submit pull requests. 
I am open to collaborations and eager to learn from the community.

Acknowledgments
